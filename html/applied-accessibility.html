<!-- Wrap Radio Buttons in a fieldset Element for Better Accessibility -->
<!--
    The fieldset tag surrounds the entire grouping of radio buttons to indicate theres a way to semanticallly show the choices are part of a set.
     It often uses a legend tag to provide a description for the grouping, which screen readers read for each choice in the fieldset element.
    The fieldset wrapper and legend tag are not necessary when the choices are self-explanatory, like a gender selection. Using a label with the for attribute for each radio button is sufficient.-->
<form>
    <fieldset>
        <legend>Choose one of these three items:</legend>
        <input id="one" type="radio" name="items" value="one">
        <label for="one">Choice One</label><br>
        <input id="two" type="radio" name="items" value="two">
        <label for="two">Choice Two</label><br>
        <input id="three" type="radio" name="items" value="three">
        <label for="three">Choice Three</label>
    </fieldset>
</form>

<!-- Make Elements Only Visible to a Screen Reader by Using Custom CSS -->
<!-- 
    Information is in a visual format (like a chart), but screen reader users need an alternative presentation (like a table) to access the data. CSS is used to position the screen reader-only elements off the visual area of the browser window -->
<!-- 
    display: none; or visibility: hidden; hides content for everyone, including screen reader users
    Zero values for pixel sizes, such as width: 0px; height: 0px; removes that element from the flow of your document, meaning screen readers will ignore it -->
<style>
    .sr-only {
        position: absolute;
        left: -10000px;
        width: 1px;
        height: 1px;
        top: auto;
        overflow: hidden;
    }
</style>



<!-- Improve Readability with High Contrast Text -->
<!-- 
    The Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) recommend at least a 4.5 to 1 contrast ratio for normal text. The ratio is calculated by comparing the relative luminance values of two colors. This ranges from 1:1 for the same color, or no contrast, to 21:1 for white against black, the most substantial contrast. There are many contrast checking tools available online that calculate this ratio for you. -->



<!-- Make Links Navigable with HTML Access Keys -->
<!-- 
    HTML5 allows this attribute to be used on any element, but it's particularly useful when it's used with interactive ones. This includes links, buttons, and form controls. -->
<button accesskey="b">Important Button</button>



<!-- Use tabindex to Add Keyboard Focus to an Element -->
<!-- 
    When it's on a tag, it indicates that the element can be focused on
    Certain elements, such as links and form controls, automatically receive keyboard focus when a user tabs through a page. 
    It's in the same order as the elements come in the HTML source markup. This same functionality can be given to other elements, such as div, span, and p, by placing a tabindex="0" attribute on them.
 -->
<div tabindex="0">I need keyboard focus!</div>
