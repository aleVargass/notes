<!-- Create a Set of Radio Buttons or Checkboxes-->
<!-- 
    Each of your radio buttons can be nested within its own label element. By wrapping an input element inside of a label element it will automatically associate the radio button input with the label element surrounding it.
    All related radio buttons should have the same name attribute to create a radio button group. 
    By creating a radio group, selecting any single radio button will automatically deselect the other buttons within the same group ensuring only one answer is provided by the user. -->
<label>
    <input type="radio" name="indoor-outdoor">Indoor
</label>
<!-- 
    It is considered best practice to set a for attribute on the label element, with a value that matches the value of the id attribute of the input element. This allows assistive technologies to create a linked relationship between the label and the related input element.  -->
<label for="indoor">
    <input id="indoor" type="radio" name="indoor-outdoor">Indoor
</label>

<!-- 
    Inputs of type radio and checkbox report their values from the value attribute.
    If you omit the value attribute, the submitted form data uses the default value, which is on.  -->

<!-- 
        You can set a checkbox or radio button to be checked by default using the checked attribute. -->
<input type="radio" name="test-name" checked>
